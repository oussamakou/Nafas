# 🛡️ Q&A CHEAT SHEET (POCKET SIZE)

## **HARD NUMBERS**
- **ROI:** 1K inv → 15K rev = **15x** (Year 1)
- **Market:** 50 Zones × $40K avg = **$2M/yr**
- **Pricing:** Muni (15K) | Factory (25K + 5K/yr)
- **Cost:** 60 TND BOM vs $300 PurpleAir
- **Accuracy:** ±10% (Trend analysis, not lab grade)

## **TOUGH QUESTIONS**
**1. "Municipalities won't pay."**
> "Freemium pressure. Citizens get free SMS → They pressure Mayor. Also, it's cheaper than ANPE (50K vs 15K)."

**2. "Factories will bribe/hide data."**
> "They can't. Municipality owns the dashboard. Citizens see the data. Transparency kills corruption."

**3. "Why not PurpleAir?"**
> "Too expensive ($300), no Arabic SMS, no Phosphate dust sensors. We are built for *here*."

**4. "15x ROI is impossible."**
> "It's SaaS math. 1K hardware cost unlocks 15K recurring software revenue. High margin."

**5. "What if you lose?"**
> "We build anyway. Salsabil is still sick. We just go slower."

## **IF YOU FREEZE:**
> "That's a great question. The short answer is **[DATA/MONEY/IMPACT]**. But ultimately, we do this because **it's personal**."
