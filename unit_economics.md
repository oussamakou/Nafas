# 💰 Unit Economics Breakdown (The "Napkin Math")

## 1. HARDWARE COSTS (One-Time)
**Cost to Build ONE Sensor Node (BOM):**
- Microcontroller (ESP32): 15 TND
- Sensors (PMS5003 + DHT11): 25 TND
- Casing & PCB: 10 TND
- Power/Battery: 10 TND
- **TOTAL BOM:** **60 TND**

**Deployment Cost (Per Municipality - 10 Sensors):**
- 10 Sensors x 60 TND = 600 TND
- 1 LoRaWAN Gateway = 300 TND
- Installation Labor (2 Engineers x 1 Day) = 200 TND
- **TOTAL DEPLOYMENT COST:** **1,100 TND** (This is your "CAC" - Customer Acquisition Cost)

---

## 2. OPERATING COSTS (Annual)
**Running Costs (Per Municipality/Year):**
- Server/Cloud Hosting: 200 TND
- SMS Gateway Fees: 100 TND
- Maintenance (Replacement parts): 200 TND
- **TOTAL OPEX:** **500 TND / Year**

## 3. REVENUE (Annual)
**Municipal Contract:**
- **Price:** **15,000 TND / Year**

---

## 4. PROFITABILITY (Year 1)
- **Revenue:** 15,000 TND
- **(-) Deployment Cost:** 1,100 TND
- **(-) Operating Cost:** 500 TND
- **= NET PROFIT:** **13,400 TND**

**👉 MARGIN:** **89%** (This is why Software/SaaS models are powerful)
