## 2. Team (20s)
**Script:**
> We are Team **SABKHA**.
> 
> We're not here to talk about a hypothetical problem. We're here because it's **personal**.
> 
> For 50 years, Gabes has been suffocating under industrial pollution with zero data, zero accountability, and zero hope. We're building Nafas to change that.

## 3. Salsabil's Story (45s)
**Script:**
> Three years ago, my sister Salsabil moved to Gabes to study at the university. She was 21 and healthy.
> 
> Within a year, she developed chronic respiratory illness.
> 
> When we went to the doctors, they couldn't prove the cause. Why? Because there was **no data**. No way to connect her illness to the air she was breathing.
> 
> Salsabil's story is not unique. It's happening to thousands of students and families. And it's happening in silence.

## 4. Current Solutions (30s)
**Script:**
> Right now, our only defense is ANPE.
> 
> They do manual monitoring once a year. The data is hidden, slow, and expensive.
> 
> Nafas changes everything. We provide **real-time monitoring, 24/7**.
> 
> We offer **70% cost reduction** and **365 times more data points** than the current system.

## 5. Innovation (30s)
**Script:**
> How do we do it? Three innovations:
> 
> 1. **Calibration:** We tune our sensors specifically for industrial pollutants like phosphate dust.
> 2. **Low Cost:** We build locally for 60 TND, compared to $300 for imported sensors.
> 3. **Freemium Model:** Citizens get free SMS alerts, creating the political pressure that forces municipalities to pay.

## 6. Dashboard Demo (30s)
**Script:**
> This is our live dashboard.
> 
> On the left, real-time pollution levels. On the right, a heat map of toxic hotspots.
> 
> We track wind patterns to predict where the smoke is going. We send SMS alerts *before* the air gets toxic.
> 
> This is the data Salsabil's doctors needed.

## 7. Revenue Streams (30s)
**Script:**
> We have two revenue streams:
> 
> **1. Municipalities:** Pay 15,000 TND/year for city-wide monitoring and public reports.
> 
> **2. Industrial Zones:** Pay 25,000 TND + subscription for compliance monitoring.
> 
> Why would they pay? Because the EU's Carbon Border Tax hits in 2026. Factories without data will face massive penalties. We are their compliance insurance.

## 11. The Ask (45s)
**Script:**

> With this 1,000 TND, we secure one municipal contract worth 15,000 TND. That is a **15x ROI** in Year 1.
> 
> We're not asking for charity. We're asking you to fund a profitable solution.

# 🧠 How to Memorize in 2 Hours (The "Loci Method")

You don't need to memorize *words*. You need to memorize **landmarks**.

### Step 1: The "Room Walk" (Mental Map)
Imagine your bedroom or a familiar room. Place each slide in a specific corner or object.

1.  **Door:** Team SABKHA (Oussama & Aziz standing there)
2.  **Bed:** Salsabil (Sitting there, coughing - *emotional anchor*)
3.  **Window:** ANPE vs Nafas (Old dusty window vs Clear glass)
4.  **Desk:** Innovation (Sensors on the table)
5.  **Computer:** Dashboard (Glowing screen)
6.  **Closet:** Revenue (Money bags inside)
7.  **Mirror:** Impact (Seeing healthy people)
8.  **Chair:** Competition (PurpleAir box broken on the floor)
9.  **Rug:** Market Size (Map of North Africa)
10. **Light Switch:** The Ask (Turning on the light = 1,000 TND)

**Practice:** Walk through your room mentally. "Door... Team. Bed... Salsabil. Window... Solution."

### Step 2: Key Phrases Only
Don't memorize sentences. Memorize **Trigger Phrases**:
- **Team:** "It's personal."
- **Salsabil:** "No data."
- **Solution:** "70% cheaper, 365x more data."
- **Revenue:** "Compliance Insurance."
- **Ask:** "15x ROI."

### Step 3: The "No-Look" Drill
1.  Stand up.
2.  Look at a blank wall.
3.  Visualize the "Room Walk".
4.  Say the Trigger Phrase for each object.
5.  **Do not look at slides.** If you get stuck, look at your "mental room", not the screen.

### Step 4: Emergency Recovery
If you blank out, **look at the slide title**.
- Title says "Revenue"? Say: "We make money from cities and factories."
- Title says "Impact"? Say: "We save lives and money."
- **Trust the slide.** It is your teleprompter.

**You got this. Breathe.**
