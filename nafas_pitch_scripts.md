# Nafas Pitch Deck - Scripts & Q&A

**Total Duration:** ~8-10 minutes  
**Tone:** Confident, personal, data-driven

---

## Slide 1: Logo (5 seconds)
**Script:**
> [Pause for logo to appear]  
> Good morning. My name is Oussama, and this is Nafas.

**Transition:** Press next immediately.

---

## Slide 2: Agenda (20 seconds)
**Script:**
> Today, I'll walk you through five things:  
> 1. The invisible crisis affecting 150,000 people in my hometown  
> 2. How Nafas solves it with real-time air quality monitoring  
> 3. A live demo of our platform  
> 4. Our business model  
> 5. And our call to action  
> 
> Let's start with why this matters.

**Transition:** "Let me introduce the team."

---

## Slide 3: The Team (30 seconds)
**Script:**
> We're Oussama and Aziz, computer science engineers from Gabes, Tunisia.  
> 
> We're not here to talk about a hypothetical problem. We're here because we've lived it. Gabes is our home. And for 50 years, it's been suffocating under industrial pollution with zero data, zero accountability, and zero hope.  
> 
> We're building Nafas to change that.

**Emphasis:** "We've lived it" — personal connection.  
**Transition:** "Let me show you what I mean."

---

## Slide 4: Salsabil's Story (45 seconds)
**Script:**
> Three years ago, my sister Salsabil came to university here in Gabes. She was 21, healthy, full of life.  
> 
> Within a year, she developed chronic respiratory illness.  
> 
> When we went to the doctors, they couldn't prove the cause. Why? Because there was no data. No way to connect her illness to the air she was breathing. No accountability for the factories. No way to protect her.  
> 
> Salsabil's story is not unique. It's happening to thousands of families across North Africa. And it's happening in silence.

**Emphasis:** Slow down. Make eye contact. Let the emotion land.  
**Transition:** "So what's the problem exactly?"

---

## Slide 5: The Problem (30 seconds)
**Script:**
> The problem is simple but devastating:  
> 
> **NO DATA** — Industrial zones across North Africa lack air monitoring infrastructure. We are flying blind.  
> 
> **NO ACTION** — Without data, cities can't regulate, factories can't improve, and families like mine can't protect themselves.  
> 
> For 50 years, Gabes has been a black box. No one knows what we're breathing.

**Transition:** "But here's the solution."

---

## Slide 6: The Solution (40 seconds)
**Script:**
> Nafas is a real-time air quality monitoring network built for industrial cities.  
> 
> We deploy low-cost IoT sensors at scale to make pollution visible. But here's the key: we don't just collect data for free. We sell it to those who need it most — municipalities and factories.  
> 
> This isn't charity. It's a profitable service that creates accountability.  
> 
> Municipalities get compliance monitoring. Factories get proof for EU regulations. And citizens? They finally get the truth.

**Emphasis:** "Profitable service" — this is a business.  
**Transition:** "You might ask: don't solutions already exist?"

---

## Slide 7: Current Solutions (ANPE vs Nafas) (45 seconds)
**Script:**
> Right now, Tunisia has ANPE — the National Agency for Environmental Protection.  
> 
> They do manual monitoring once or twice a year. Lab analysis takes 2-4 weeks. The data never reaches the public. And it costs municipalities around 50,000 TND per year for limited coverage.  
> 
> Nafas changes everything:  
> - Real-time monitoring, 24/7  
> - Instant data visualization  
> - Public API and SMS alerts  
> - Full coverage for 15,000 TND per year  
> 
> That's **70% cost reduction** and **365 times more data points**.

**Emphasis:** "70% cost reduction, 365x more data" — let it land.  
**Transition:** "So how is this innovative?"

---

## Slide 8: Innovation (40 seconds)
**Script:**
> Three key innovations:  
> 
> **1. Sensor Calibration** — We custom-tune our sensors for industrial pollutants like fluoride and phosphate dust that standard sensors miss.  
> 
> **2. Low-Cost Hardware** — Our build cost is 60 TND using commodity components. Compare that to PurpleAir at $300 USD.  
> 
> **3. Freemium Model** — Free for citizens via SMS alerts. Paid for municipalities and factories. This creates political pressure while generating revenue.  
> 
> We're built for Tunisia, but scalable to North Africa.

**Transition:** "Let me show you what this looks like."

---

## Slide 9: Dashboard Demo (30 seconds)
**Script:**
> This is our live dashboard.  
> 
> On the left, real-time pollution levels across Gabes. On the right, a heat map showing pollution hotspots.  
> 
> We track wind patterns to predict pollution drift. We send SMS alerts when levels spike. And we monitor industrial compounds like fluoride that standard sensors ignore.  
> 
> This is the data Salsabil's doctors needed.

**Emphasis:** Point to the screen. Make it tangible.  
**Transition:** "So who pays for this?"

---

## Slide 10: Revenue Streams (40 seconds)
**Script:**
> We have two main revenue streams:  
> 
> **Municipalities** pay 15,000 TND per year for:  
> - Real-time city dashboard  
> - Monthly environmental reports  
> - Public API access  
> 
> **Industrial zones** pay 25,000 TND installation plus 5,000 TND annually for:  
> - Compliance monitoring  
> - Leak detection alerts  
> - Impact assessment reports  
> 
> For them, this is compliance insurance. The EU's Carbon Border Adjustment hits in 2026. Factories without emissions data will face penalties up to 20% of export value.

**Transition:** "But this isn't just about revenue."

---

## Slide 11: Potential Impact (45 seconds)
**Script:**
> Let's talk impact.  
> 
> **Health:** 150,000 people in Gabes will gain access to air quality data for the first time in history. Early warning systems have been shown to reduce exposure to harmful pollutants.  
> 
> **Economic:** Municipalities save 70% on environmental monitoring costs. Factories avoid EU CBAM penalties worth millions of dinars.  
> 
> **Social:** Public data drives accountability. Tunisia passed a new Environmental Code in 2020, but enforcement is weak because there's no data. We provide the data. We empower citizens to hold their governments and industries accountable.

**Emphasis:** "We empower citizens" — this is the mission.  
**Transition:** "So why us?"

---

## Slide 12: Competition (35 seconds)
**Script:**
> You might ask: don't solutions like PurpleAir or IQAir already exist?  
> 
> Yes. But they're not built for us.  
> 
> **Cost:** Our build cost is 60 TND. PurpleAir costs $300 USD retail.  
> 
> **Locals First:** We prioritize citizens. We alert our platform users of intoxicated areas with SMS in Arabic and French.  
> 
> **Industrial Focus:** We track fluoride and phosphate dust — compounds that consumer sensors ignore.  
> 
> We're built for markets they don't serve.

**Transition:** "And here's how we scale."

---

## Slide 13: Growth Strategy (30 seconds)
**Script:**
> Our growth strategy has three phases:  
> 
> **Phase 1: Gabes** — An 18-month pilot. Deploy sensors, validate data, secure our first municipal contract.  
> 
> **Phase 2: Sfax and Gafsa** — Expand to Tunisia's other industrial cities.  
> 
> **Phase 3: Regional expansion** — Algeria, Libya, Morocco. That's a 100 million person total addressable market.  
> 
> We start local. We scale regional.

**Transition:** "So here's what we're asking for."

---

## Slide 14: The Ask (60 seconds)
**Script:**
> We're asking for 1,000 TND to launch our pilot in Gabes.  
> 
> Here's how we'll use it:  
> - 400 TND: 7 additional sensors  
> - 300 TND: LoRaWAN gateway for 10km coverage  
> - 200 TND: 6 months of server and SMS costs  
> - 100 TND: Municipal outreach  
> 
> **The economics are simple:**  
> We invest 1,000 TND. We validate the data. We secure one municipal contract worth 15,000 TND per year. That's a **15x return on investment** in Year 1.  
> 
> But this isn't just about ROI. This is about breaking 50 years of silence. This is about giving families like mine the data to protect themselves.  
> 
> We're not asking you to fund a dream. We're asking you to fund a solution that's already working.

**Emphasis:** "15x ROI" and "already working" — confidence.  
**Transition:** "Let me bring this home."

---

## Slide 15: Closing (30 seconds)
**Script:**
> Nafas means "breath" in Arabic.  
> 
> For 50 years, Gabes has been suffocating in silence. No data. No accountability. No hope.  
> 
> Nafas breaks that silence.  
> 
> We're building profitable transparency with regional impact. And we're asking for your support to make it happen.  
> 
> Thank you.

**Emphasis:** Pause after "Nafas breaks that silence." Let it resonate.  
**Transition:** "I'm happy to take questions."

---

## Slide 16: Questions?

**Script:**
> [Point to QR code if present]  
> I'm happy to answer any questions.

# Anticipated Q&A

## 1. "How do you ensure data accuracy?"
**Answer:**  
> Great question. We use multi-sensor validation — each location has redundant sensors cross-referencing each other. We also partner with Gabes University's Environmental Science Department to validate our readings against lab-grade equipment. Our goal is ±10% accuracy, which is sufficient for trend analysis and early warning.

## 2. "What if municipalities don't pay?"
**Answer:**  
> We have a freemium model specifically to address this. Citizens get free access via SMS alerts, which creates political pressure. If a municipality refuses to pay for monitoring, citizens will ask why. Additionally, we're positioning this as compliance insurance for the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which hits in 2026. Not having data will be more expensive than paying us.

## 3. "Why can't PurpleAir or IQAir just enter this market?"
**Answer:**  
> They could, but they won't. Here's why: Our build cost is 60 TND because we source locally and use commodity hardware. PurpleAir's retail price is $300 USD — they can't compete on cost in Tunisia. Second, we support Arabic and French SMS alerts. They don't. Third, we track industrial pollutants like fluoride and phosphate dust. They don't. We're not just cheaper — we're purpose-built for this market.

## 4. "How do you scale beyond Tunisia?"
**Answer:**  
> Our technology is platform-agnostic. LoRaWAN is a global standard. Our software is cloud-based. We can deploy in any city with industrial pollution. Tunisia is our proof of concept. Once we validate here, we license the model to Algeria, Morocco, and Libya. We don't need to build infrastructure in every country — we partner with local NGOs and municipalities who want the solution.

## 5. "What's your biggest risk?"
**Answer:**  
> Regulatory pushback. Tunisia's environmental enforcement is weak, and some might see us as a threat. That's why we're partnering with advisors who understand the regulatory landscape. We're also positioning ourselves as a complement to ANPE, not a replacement. We provide 365x more data points — we make their job easier, not harder.

## 6. "Do you have any traction?"
**Answer:**  
> We're a 24-hour hackathon project, so we don't have deployed sensors yet. But we have the technical expertise, we've built the platform, and we have a clear path to market. This competition is our launchpad. With 1,000 TND, we deploy in Gabes within 6 months.

## 7. "Why should we invest in you vs other teams?"
**Answer:**  
> Because this is personal. Salsabil is my sister. Gabes is my home. We're not solving a hypothetical problem — we're solving our problem. And we're doing it with a profitable business model that scales. This isn't charity. It's a 15x ROI opportunity with regional impact.

## 8. "What happens if you don't win this competition?"
**Answer:**  
> We build anyway. It'll just take longer. We'll bootstrap with personal savings, deploy a smaller pilot, and prove the model. But with your support, we can move faster, deploy bigger, and create impact sooner. That's why we're here.
